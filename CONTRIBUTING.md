## Issues

Since this is a new app being developed, we won't be using GitHub Issues to track requests. We are using the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc) page for areas that we're looking for help and contributions.

The [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app/issues?query=is%3Aopen) section will be used to track public bugs. Please ensure your bug description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue:

- A summary and/or background of the bug
- Steps to reproduce the bug
    - please be specific
    - provide sample code if possible
- What you expect should happen
- What actually happens
- Any additional notes
    - why you think this might be happening
    - methods you've tried already that didn't work
